# Daily DSA Practice in Java

Welcome to my Daily DSA Practice repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms questions solved daily in Java.

## About
This repository serves as a personal log of my journey in mastering DSA concepts and improving problem-solving skills. Each day, I commit to solving a set of DSA questions and implement them in Java. I also document the sources I consult during my study and practice.

## Contents
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions to algorithmic problems including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.

## Structure
The solutions are organized within the root directory. Each Java file represents a solution to a specific DSA question. File names are typically indicative of the problem or algorithm solved. Additionally, I maintain a README.md file in each directory detailing the sources I consulted for that day's practice.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own solutions or improvements. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced coder willing to share insights, your contributions are valuable!

Let's embark on this journey of mastering DSA together!
